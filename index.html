    <h2>Dear Shae,</h2>
    <p>
      To the girl I love the most, I wish you the happiest 17th birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a lot I would like to say to you, but I can't find the words appropriate for it. But I'm going to say these words; you were the greatest sunlight that ever striked my skin. This analogy best explains what you are to me. The first time I had feelings for you, it was sudden. It almsot seemed like a "rebound" due to the pace; however it wasn't. I was already sure I liked you at the time.  Something about you attracted me. Probably your outgoing and lovable personality. I really liked you back then. But now, I don't like you. 'Cause I love you and every inch of you so much. Your persona, yourself. I love every part of you cause every part of you screams you. It's a feeling where you know that your partner is the most perfect being you could have ever asked for because you're willing to accept any flaws they might have and love them for it. I am so lucky to have you and I hope you know that. This reminds me of one lyric piece of Balisong by Rico Blanco. 'You can thank your stars all you want but, I'll always be the lucky one.' Cause this is so true. You can thank the stars for leading you to me, but I'll always be luckier than you cause God gave me you. I'm honestly impressed and inspired by you; how you deal with your problems, and how you survive each upset. I admire your independence and being able to go through all your problems by yourself. I hope you know just how great you are, if not I am here to remind you everyday. Keep smiling, and share the sweetness wherever you go.
